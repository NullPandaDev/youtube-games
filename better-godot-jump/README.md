# Genuine problems
1. Ending
    1. Game over
    1. Ramp up of dificulty until death
1. The algorithm for bees to find flowers is badly broken
1. The sort of meta way to play currently would be to escourt mission 1 bee and just wait till the last moment to kill only the closest bees


===
1. Staying on a flower doesn't pick it up
1. Pause menu

# Things
1. Death should happen to the player. Introduces a increasing cooldown like in league of legends
1. Would be cool to have a really short range knife (maybe)
1. How to make the game inevetably end?
1. Game is most fun when juggling friendly bees
1. 1 way portals
